%Our understanding of the dynamics of the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud is at a very early stage, but whatâ€™s the betting that these turn out to be vibrant dynamic structures dominated by resonances, gaps, and chaos

The large orbital period and isotropic inclinations make LPCs rare and inefficient Earth impactors, but little is known about the nature of the transport mechanisms that bring them close to Earth.

if indeed the YDB event was an astronomical catastro-
phe, its occurrence bears little relation to current impact
hazard assessments derived from NEO surveys.

Since comets appear to be observable only at the expense of rapid ageing in the vicinity of the Sun, chaotic routes are considered necessary in order to bring them from their remote places of origin and storage.
