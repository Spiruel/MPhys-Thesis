  abstract={A back-and-forth orbit integration technique, developed for our previous investigation of the splitting of the parent of the sungrazers C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1, is now applied in an effort to understand the history and orbital evolution of the Kreutz sungrazer system, starting with the birth of two subgroups, which show prominently among the bright members and whose inception dates back to the progenitor's breakup into two superfragments. The integration technique is used to reproduce the motion of comet C/1843 D1—the second brightest sungrazer known and presumably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment I—from the motion of C/1882 R1—the brightest sungrazer on record and arguably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment II. Running the orbit of C/1882 R1 back to A . D . 326, the progenitor comet is found to have split at a heliocentric distance of 50 AU and nearly 30 yr before perihelion. The superfragments acquired separation velocities of ~8 m s -1 in opposite directions. Using the same technique, we show next that (1) the motions of two additional sungrazers, C/1880 C1 and C/1887 B1, are matched extremely well if these objects shared a common parent with C/1843 D1, and (2) C/1963 R1 (Pereyra), the second brightest subgroup I member on record, is more closely related to subgroup II objects (such as C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1) than to C/1843 D1. This finding raises serious doubts about the major role of the subgroups in the system's orbital history and offers an incentive for considering an alternative dynamical scenario. The fragmentation models for C/1963 R1 and two additional bright sungrazers, C/1945 X1 and C/1970 K1, suggest that (1) these comets may have been the most massive pieces of the fragment populations formed from their respective disintegrating parents, and (2) the course of evolution of the Kreutz system at the upper end of the mass spectrum may be better ascertained from the distribution of the sungrazers' arrival times than from the sources of subgroups. If so, the fragment hierarchy should be determined primarily by the cascading nature of the fragmentation process, which was recently shown by Sekanina to control the evolution of minor fragments as well. The sungrazer system's estimated age is in any case very short, less than 1700 yr.}

abstract="Splitting events affect cometary nuclei to a different level of severity ranging from complete disruption of the nucleus (e.g., C/1999 S4 LINEAR) to separation of major fragments (e.g., 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and spill-offs of smaller boulders (e.g., C/2001 A2 LINEAR).Fragmentation of comets produces secondary products over a wide range of sizes (from cometesimals to sub-micron dust). It is detectable through the presence of fragments (with own comae and tails) in the coma of the parent nucleus, through outbursts in its activity and through arc-lets (``coma wings'')associated with fragments. The secondaries have different life times and show different non-gravitational forces. Nucleus splitting is also considered to generate whole families of comets (Kreutz group) or --- if gravitational bound --- multiple nuclei (e.g., C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp). It may explain the striae phenomena seen in dust tails of bright comets (C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp) and the detection of chains of impact craters onother bodies in the solar system. As process of significant mass loss it is relevant for the scenario of nucleus extinction, at the same time it also plays a role for the number statistics of existing (observable) comets and for the size distribution of comet nuclei. Various model scenarios for nucleus splitting are proposed: tidal disruption, rotational splitting, break-up due to internal gas pressure, fragmentation due to collision with other bodies. Only in one case, Comet D/1993 F1Shoemaker-Levy 9, the physical process of fragmentation could be undoubtedly identified. In any case, comet splitting provides important insights inthe internal structure, surface layering and chemistry of comet nuclei.",

Perturbation of the atmospheric carbon cycle at the boundary likely lasted less than 5000 years, exhibiting a recovery time scale two to three orders of magnitude shorter than that of the major ocean basins. Low-diversity mammalian fauna in the western Williston Basin persisted for as little as 20,000 years after the impact. The Chicxulub impact likely triggered a state shift of ecosystems already under near-critical stress.},

abstract="Various aspects of comet/asteroid distinctions and interrelations are reviewed with emphasis on recent work and paying special attention to the following problems: characteristics of cometary activity at large heliocentric distance and uniqueness of comet P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 with respect to physical properties, the r{\^o}le of Trojans and other small bodies in the outer planetary system concerning comet/asteroid classification, possibilities for physical evolution of comets into asteroids, orbital and dynamical overlap of the comet and asteroid populations, and the cometary versus asteroidal origin of Earth-approaching asteroids. With regard to these latter questions it is argued that recent discoveries indicate a more substantial probability for Jupiter family comets to develop into asteroidal objects than earlier believed, and several examples of cometary association for newly discovered Apollo-Amor asteroids are also referred to. However, the fractional cometary contribution to the traditional Apollo-Amor asteroid population (aphelia far inside Jupiter's orbit) apparently can not yet be reliably estimated.",

  abstract={We describe the Pan-STARRS Moving Object Processing System (MOPS), a modern software package that produces automatic asteroid discoveries and identifications from catalogs of transient detections from next-generation astronomical survey telescopes. MOPS achieves >99.5\% efficiency in producing orbits from a synthetic but realistic population of asteroids whose measurements were simulated for a Pan-STARRS4-class telescope. Additionally, using a nonphysical grid population, we demonstrate that MOPS can detect populations of currently unknown objects such as interstellar asteroids. MOPS has been adapted successfully to the prototype Pan-STARRS1 telescope despite differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss, and relatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical Pan-STARRS4 telescope and survey. MOPS remains highly efficient at detecting objects but drops to 80\% efficiency at producing orbits. This loss is primarily due to configurable MOPS processing limits that are not yet tuned for the Pan-STARRS1 mission. The core MOPS software package is the product of more than 15 person-years of software development and incorporates countless additional years of effort in third-party software to perform lower-level functions such as spatial searching or orbit determination. We describe the high-level design of MOPS and essential subcomponents, the suitability of MOPS for other survey programs, and suggest a road map for future MOPS development.}

abstract="The ``Shiva Hypothesis'', in which recurrent, cyclical mass extinctions of life on Earth result from impacts of comets or asteroids, provides a possible unification of important processes in astrophysics, planetary geology, and the history of life. Collisions with Earth-crossing asteroids and comets ≥ a few km in diameter are calculated to produce widespread environmental disasters (dust clouds, wildfires), and occur with the proper frequency to account for the record of five major mass extinctions (from ≥ 108 Mt TNT impacts) and {\textasciitilde} 20 minor mass extinctions (from 107--108 Mt impacts) recorded in the past 540 million years. Recent studies of a number of extinctions show evidence of severe environmental disturbances and mass mortality consistent with the expected after-effects (dust clouds, wildfires) of catastrophic impacts. At least six cases of features generally considered diagnostic of large impacts (e.g., large impact craters, layers with high platinum-group elements, shock-related minerals, and/or microtektites) are known at or close to extinction-event boundaries. Six additional cases of elevated iridium levels at or near extinction boundaries are of the amplitude that might be expected from collision of relatively low-Ir objects such as comets.",
