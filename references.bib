  abstract={A back-and-forth orbit integration technique, developed for our previous investigation of the splitting of the parent of the sungrazers C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1, is now applied in an effort to understand the history and orbital evolution of the Kreutz sungrazer system, starting with the birth of two subgroups, which show prominently among the bright members and whose inception dates back to the progenitor's breakup into two superfragments. The integration technique is used to reproduce the motion of comet C/1843 D1—the second brightest sungrazer known and presumably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment I—from the motion of C/1882 R1—the brightest sungrazer on record and arguably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment II. Running the orbit of C/1882 R1 back to A . D . 326, the progenitor comet is found to have split at a heliocentric distance of 50 AU and nearly 30 yr before perihelion. The superfragments acquired separation velocities of ~8 m s -1 in opposite directions. Using the same technique, we show next that (1) the motions of two additional sungrazers, C/1880 C1 and C/1887 B1, are matched extremely well if these objects shared a common parent with C/1843 D1, and (2) C/1963 R1 (Pereyra), the second brightest subgroup I member on record, is more closely related to subgroup II objects (such as C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1) than to C/1843 D1. This finding raises serious doubts about the major role of the subgroups in the system's orbital history and offers an incentive for considering an alternative dynamical scenario. The fragmentation models for C/1963 R1 and two additional bright sungrazers, C/1945 X1 and C/1970 K1, suggest that (1) these comets may have been the most massive pieces of the fragment populations formed from their respective disintegrating parents, and (2) the course of evolution of the Kreutz system at the upper end of the mass spectrum may be better ascertained from the distribution of the sungrazers' arrival times than from the sources of subgroups. If so, the fragment hierarchy should be determined primarily by the cascading nature of the fragmentation process, which was recently shown by Sekanina to control the evolution of minor fragments as well. The sungrazer system's estimated age is in any case very short, less than 1700 yr.}

abstract="Splitting events affect cometary nuclei to a different level of severity ranging from complete disruption of the nucleus (e.g., C/1999 S4 LINEAR) to separation of major fragments (e.g., 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and spill-offs of smaller boulders (e.g., C/2001 A2 LINEAR).Fragmentation of comets produces secondary products over a wide range of sizes (from cometesimals to sub-micron dust). It is detectable through the presence of fragments (with own comae and tails) in the coma of the parent nucleus, through outbursts in its activity and through arc-lets (``coma wings'')associated with fragments. The secondaries have different life times and show different non-gravitational forces. Nucleus splitting is also considered to generate whole families of comets (Kreutz group) or --- if gravitational bound --- multiple nuclei (e.g., C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp). It may explain the striae phenomena seen in dust tails of bright comets (C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp) and the detection of chains of impact craters onother bodies in the solar system. As process of significant mass loss it is relevant for the scenario of nucleus extinction, at the same time it also plays a role for the number statistics of existing (observable) comets and for the size distribution of comet nuclei. Various model scenarios for nucleus splitting are proposed: tidal disruption, rotational splitting, break-up due to internal gas pressure, fragmentation due to collision with other bodies. Only in one case, Comet D/1993 F1Shoemaker-Levy 9, the physical process of fragmentation could be undoubtedly identified. In any case, comet splitting provides important insights inthe internal structure, surface layering and chemistry of comet nuclei.",
